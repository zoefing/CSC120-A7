- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I chose to overload the constructor twice for House, once for Library and then addTitle, and then finally the constructor once for Cafe and then sellCoffee. I did this b/c they seemed like they would have a real-world application. For example, for the House object, I often only care about the name and address and whether it has a dining hall! Likewise, for the Library object, sometimes I only care about which Library it is (name) and how many floors of study spaces it has. I also wanted to add the option to add a book with an unknown title to the collection. Finally, I overloaded the Cafe object to have a constructor with only name and address and an option to sell coffee without caring about anything other than size.

The hardest part for me was deciding what to overload! I would recommend that future students find a peer to talk out overloading with, as it can be a bit confusing at times (especially the difference between overloading and overriding).
